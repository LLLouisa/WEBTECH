        <p>Babson has ranked number one in entrepreneurship in the United States. When I visited Babson, the small class ratio, the alumni network and the Center for Career Development all intrigued me a lot. Upon graduation, I want to step in the management consulting industry. The experience of working as a part time assistant at Boston Consulting Group sparkled my curiosity to know more about strategic management. Consultants are always curious, talented and fast-learning, and they focus on a 360degree view to approach a certain problem. What makes me be more passionate about consulting is the fact that I am able to get new insights of different industries, to respond quickly to a new situation and to interact with people constantly.</p> 

        <p>I love running and extreme sports. I used to run women 400m and women 800m in junior high school and started to run half marathon in high school. While running, I take a moment to escape, to meditate, to relax, and to think about nothing. So far, I have accomplished 2014 and 2015 Chongqing Marathon and 2018 Paris Marathon and I really want to participate in 2019 Boston Marathon.  </p>
